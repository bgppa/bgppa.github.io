<h1>Ninja Gaiden 2</h1>

The goal of my first run is to end the game at normal difficulty,
using ONLY the Dragon Sword and collecting all the skulls.


Here there is a list of chapters, to keep track:
- 

<ul>
	<li> Chapter 1:
	In the City, trying to save Sonia who knows about great fiend.
	But it was only a method to distract me while they attack the
	Hayabusa Village. </li>

	<li> Chapter 2: 
	I go back to my village, in flame, and at the end help my father
	in fighting the enemy ninja. Me + father VS Enemy + Woman.
	I follow the woman, who escapes with the demon statue.
	My father stays in the village, fighing the Enemy.
	</li>


	<li> Chapter 3:
	Because of the Demon Statue, dark force is unleashed on Manhattan.
	I go there and I find my way between destroyed buildings,
	ultimately going in the underground where I kill the electric worm.
	But the thunder power of the Fiends is still active.
	</li>

	<li> Chapter 4:
	The goal is to fight the "main Fiend of thunder", who controls
	lightinings from the peak of the Statue of Liberty.
	Then I emerge from the underground and find my way until
	facing him.
	</li>

</ul>


And here summing up the save slots:

<ul>

	<li> 1: Spider Boss, level 1 </li>
	<li> 2: Spider Boss again, level 2 </li>
	<li> 3: Ending boss of chapter 2, the flaming ninja </li>
	<li> 4: Ending boss of chapter 3, the electric worm </li>
	<li> 5: miniboss of chapter 4, dark souls </li>
	<li> 6: current </li>

</ul>
