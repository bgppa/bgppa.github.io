11 - The Path to Zarkhan -
In this session we start and complete chapter 11, 
where we use the path opened by the water to get into a new passage 
towards the central palace. 
In the first part we have to collect two medallions, gold and silver.
Then we open a blocked door and swim in the undeground Monastery again, 
reaching at the end a new elevator. 
Using it brings us to a new floor where we face Doku.
