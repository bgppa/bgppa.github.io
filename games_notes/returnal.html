IDEA: e se andassi direttamente a sconfiggere ARCONATTO?

<p>
Important remarks:
<ul>
 <li>what is exactly the advantage when finding another player corpse?</li>
    Collect etere, collect research points, drop weapon.
 <li>I should improve my melee combat </li>
 <li> Advangate of fighting boss again? </li>
 <li> When an enemy jumps toward you, use the sword</li>

 <li> Always use the environment to YOUR advantage.</li>
 <li> vs ARCONATTO: turn around obstacles. Once defeated, he drops weapon.
    </li>

 <li> In generale, defeating enemies in important for research;</li>
 <li> High Competence = Higher Prob. to find strong weapons;</li>

 <li> I HAVE TO learn to defeat the Esuli, since I die every time;</li>
</ul>
